# <a name="about-me"
I'm a former international relations specialist and polyglot turned to public policy analyst and economist. 
 <br><br>
Programming allows me to satisfy my never-stopping-to-work mind that always seeks for solutions<br><br>
Having the opportunity to create an app that is useful to me with assistance from talented instructors from Hackbright was amazing. Charts that you want came from my personal interests and needs of visualizing the data. I have been querying database without any visual aids for too long. So, Charts for economists was born!  </a> <br><br>
